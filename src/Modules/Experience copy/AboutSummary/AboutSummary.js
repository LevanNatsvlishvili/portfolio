        In 2018.08 after taking some Udemy courses I decided I needed to gain some experience ,
        so I started looking for freelance projects and after searching up and down,
        I finally landed my first contract, in which I designed and developed markup of part of a website,
        after completing contract it was followed by other similar small projects,
        not long after my graduation from university I landed my first full time job in 2019.08,
        as fullstack developer(PHP/MYSQL), where I contributed to making company’s private application more user friendly .
        After gaining enough experience I decided to try my luck at Upwork,
        It took a lot of effort to get my first contract and it wasn’t anything big ,
        it was a start, gradually I size of projects increased until I was able to get offer to design ,
        build small crude blog and finish it.
        In 2020.05 I realized that my knowledge was lacking and it was time to move to next level,
        so I signed up for react/javascript course, which turned out to be a wonderful experience.
        After finishing the course I was able to build small clothing ecommerce shop.
        Soon after graduation I was able to get an offer as junior front-end react developer,
        which I gladly accepted and started phase of new challenges. Soon after relocation I was accepted in Georgian University,
        and started Magister of IT management.
        Aside from technical experiences , I’ve had pleasure to work in hotels,
        at front desk where I learned what is means to be professional and presentable ,
        place where my life changed to very positive direction
